# Marketing-Sales-Dashboard
This project is an interactive Marketing &amp; Sales Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze sales performance across products, categories, geographies, and sales representatives. 
The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for decision-making.

# Key Steps

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
Standardized columns and created a Date Dimension Table (Year, Quarter, Month, Day).

# Visualization:

KPI Cards (Total Revenue, Profit, Units Sold).
Line Charts (Sales Trends over time).
Stacked Column Charts (Revenue by Product & Category).
Breakdown Analysis (Region-wise & Representative-wise performance).
Slicers & Drill-throughs for interactive filtering.
